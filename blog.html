    <div>
        <h2 class="title">1. What is the difference
            between&nbsp;<code>localStorage</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>sessionStorage</code>&nbsp;?
        </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3 class="title">The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a
                Storage
                object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.</h3>
            <h3 class="title">The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current
                origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</h3>

        <h2 class="title">2. What is the difference
            between global scope and block scope?
        </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">Global Scope</span>
                <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.

            </h3>
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">Block Scope</span>
                <br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.

        <h2 class="title">3. What is event loop in JavaScript?
        </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">Event Loop</span>
                <br>
                Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives
                more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e.
                there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.

            </h3>
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">JavaScript Event Loop</span>
                <br>
                The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event
                loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.

                <span class="red">1. Uninitialized variable</span>
                <br>
                A declared variable but not yet assigned with a value (uninitialized) is by default undefined.

            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">2. Accessing a non-existing property</span>
                <br>
                When accessing a non-existing object property, JavaScript returns undefined.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">3. Function parameters when not passed a value or set to a default value
                </span>
                <br>
                The function parameters implicitly default to undefined.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">4. Function return value
                </span>
                <br>
                Implicitly, without return statement, a JavaScript function returns undefined.

            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">5. Void operator
                </span>
                <br>
                void <expression> evaluates the expression and returns undefined no matter the result of the evaluation.

                <span class="red">6. undefined in arrays
                </span>
                <br>
                You get undefined when accessing an array element with an out of bounds index.
