        <h2 class="title">1. What is the difference
            between&nbsp;<code>localStorage</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>sessionStorage</code>&nbsp;?
        </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3 class="title">The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a
                Storage
                object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.</h3>
            <h3 class="title">The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current
                origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</h3>

        <h2 class="title">2. What is the difference
            between global scope and block scope?
        </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">Global Scope</span>
                <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.

            </h3>
            <h3 class="title">
                <span class="red">Block Scope</span>
                <br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.
